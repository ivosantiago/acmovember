<h2>What the heck is this about?</h2>

<p>Each year, brave and selfless Mo Bros and Mo Sistas from all over the planet come together as one, united by their commitment to have an everlasting impact on the face of menâ€™s health. From the relatively small organizations to globally present, people devote 30 days to fine moustachery and to that we salute you.</p>

<p><strong>Join us following these simple rules:</strong></p>

<div id="rules">

	<h3>One</h3>

	<p>Each Mo Bro must begin the 1st of November with a clean shaven face.</p>

	<h3>Two</h3>

	<p>For the entire month of Movember each Mo Bro must grow and groom a moustache.</p>

	<h3>Three</h3>

	<p>There is to be no joining of the Mo to your side burns. (That's called a beard)</p>

	<h3>Four</h3>

	<p>There is to be no joining of the handlebars to your chin. (That's called a goatee)</p>

	<h3>Five</h3>

	<p>Each Mo Bro must conduct himself like a true country gentleman</p>
